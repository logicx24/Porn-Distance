Wikipedia Graph:

Uses a scraper to build a graph of wikipedia. Right now this is in MongoDB, but eventually I'm going to transfer it to Neo4j. Then, do cool shit with the data, like cluster analysis, shortest paths, cycles, degrees of separation (average path length), article discovery and recommendations, etc.

I like graphs a lot.

Also, ignore the folder names and spider names. This was supposed to be a project to find the average distance from any site to a porn site, but I got bored of that so I started this instead.
